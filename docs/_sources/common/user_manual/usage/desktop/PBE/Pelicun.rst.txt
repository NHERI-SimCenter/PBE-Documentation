Pelicun is a general-purpose performance assessment engine that is designed to integrate various methods to support performance assessment of multiple types of assets under various hazards. PBE provides a convenient interface to Pelicun to facilitate setting up and running various types of performance assessments. PBE supports the commonly used settings and analyses; advanced users are encouraged to take advantage of the full suite of features in Pelicun running the engine directly using configuration files or Python scripts.

Pelicun uses four types of models to define a performance assessment problem and set up the corresponding calculation. Each of the models has its own tab in Pelicun's input panel:
