DL: Performance Assessment
==========================

The Performance Assessment panel provides a convenient way to define the models and set up a performance assessment for a building. The dropdown list at the top of the panel lists the available performance assessment engines for the workflow. Currently, the |app| uses the Pelicun engine - other options might be added in the future.
